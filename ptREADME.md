# How to Navigate
The user starts out on the home page. The nav bar above has 4 different features that you can explore.

2. Quotes
Here, you can post your own quotes and the emotion that corresponds. All the quotes that you add will automatically be added to the gallery and put in the database. Now, when you use the camera to return a quote, there is a chance that your custom quote will be returned. Spread your own positivity!

3. Quotes Gallery
